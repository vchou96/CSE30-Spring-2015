Description: This program will display an X pattern printed to stdout. The
             four inputs that it takes refer to the size of the X pattern,
	     the ASCII values used to display the X, the ASCII values for
	     the area around the X, and the ASCII characters around the whole
	     pattern.

How to compile: The program compiles by typing "make" in the terminal.

How to run: To run the program, type the name of the executable and then
            4 integers for the 4 inputs. An example is "./pa1 8 33 34 35"

Normal output: Normal output goes to stdout. An example of normal output is:

./pa1 8 33 34 35
##########
#!""""""!#
#"!""""!"#
#""!""!""#
#"""!!"""#
#"""!!"""#
#""!""!""#
#"!""""!"#
#!""""""!#
##########


Abnormal output: Abnormal output goes to stderr. An example of abnormal
                 output is when the user inputs an extra argument.

./pa1 8 33 34 35 36

Usage: ./pa1 X_size X_char filler_char border_char
    X_size      (must be within the range of [4 - 5000])
                (must be even)
    X_char      (must be an ASCII value within the range [32 - 126])
    filler_char (must be an ASCII value within the range [32 - 126])
                (must be different than X_char)
    border_char (must be an ASCII value within the range [32 - 126])
                (must be different than X_char)
								
Testing: To test the program, I ran my program against examples provided in
         the PA1 instructions the and the sample pa0 program and compared
	 the outputs.

Questions:
1. To print the value of the string, type p/x $i0 and then x/s the address
   (0xffbff2a6).
2. Type p/d $i2 to get the decimal value 10.
3. Type p/x $i1 to get the hex value (0xffbff07c).
4. Use print localvariable (value1 in my case), or display the value in the
   register by typing p/d $o0.
5. Type p/x endptr and then x/c the address (0xffbff2a7) to get the character 'I'.
6. Type p/s endptr to get "InchNails".
7. Type p/d errno to get the decimal value.
8. The command is git status.
9. The command is git reset HEAD.
10. The command is git diff HEAD.
