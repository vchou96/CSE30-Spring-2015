Description: This program will find various anagrams from a word inputted by
             the user. First, type "./anagrams" followed by a dictionary file
             such as "word". Then, type any word and press enter and the
             program will return anagrams made from that word. If there are no
             possible anagrams, the program states "No anagrams found."
             Afterwards, the program will continuously asks for another word.
             To exit the program, type ^D.

How to compile: The program compiles by typing "make" in the terminal.

How to run: To run the program, type the name of the executable and then a
            dictionary file name. Then, type in a word to find its anagrams.

Normal output: Normal output goes to stdout. An example of normal output is:

./anagrams words
Enter a word to search for anagrams [^D to exit]: stop

Anagram(s) are: opts, OSTP, Post, post, POTS, pots, SPOT, spot, TOPS, tops


Abnormal output: Abnormal output goes to stderr. An example of abnormal
                 output is when the user inputs the incorrect amount of
                 files or an invalid file name.

./anagrams word1 word2
Usage: ./anagrams dictionary_file
        dictionary_file - containing a list of words


Testing: To test the program, I ran my program against examples provided in
         the PA3 instructions and the sample pa3 program and compared
	 the outputs.
