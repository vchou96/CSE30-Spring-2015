Description: This program will allow you to compare two different files and
             see the similarity or differences. You can enter several
             options such as -d. -i, -l, -s, and -w to change the kind of
             output shown on the terminal. -d will hide the lines that differ;
             -i will ignore capitalization; -l prints same lines only on the
             left column; -s hides lines that are the same; -w sets the output
             width. Typing --help will allow you to view all the options you
             can use as flags. 
How to compile: The program compiles by typing "make" in the terminal.

How to run: To run the program, type the name of the executable and .

Normal output: Normal output goes to stdout. An example of normal output is:
pa4$ ./mysdiff testa testb
aaa   -
bbb   bbb
ccc   ccc
ddd | sss
    + eee

Abnormal output: Abnormal output goes to stderr. An example of abnormal
                 output is when the user inputs the incorrect amount of
                 files.

pa4$ ./mysdiff -W
./mysdiff: missing operand after '-W'
./mysdiff: Try './mysdiff --help' for more information.

Testing: To test the program, I ran my program against examples provided in
         the PA4 instructions and the sample pa4 program and compared
	 the outputs.
